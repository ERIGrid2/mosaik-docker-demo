    "# Using the mosaik-docker JupyterLab extension\n",
    "\n",
    "## About\n",
    "\n",
    "This folder contains two simulation setups that demonstrate the deployment of the [mosaik co-simulation framework](https://mosaik.offis.de/) with [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ A **monolithic setup** is available in folder `monolithic`.\n",
    "  The mosaik scenario file, all simulators and all aditional resources are added to a single Docker image.\n",
    "  When running a simulation, a single container is instantiated from this image and executed on its own.\n",
    "+ A **distributed setup** is available in folder `distributed`.\n",
    "  The mosaik scenario file and the simulators can be added to separate Docker images.\n",
    "  When running a simulation, an individual container is instantiated from each of these images.\n",
    "  At runtime, these containers are executed in parallel and communicate with each other (via the [mosaik API](https://mosaik.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mosaik-api)).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Select the simulation setups via the file browser.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_browser_examples.png \"Select the simulation setups via the file browser.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running the examples\n",
    "\n",
    "The *mosaik-docker JupyterLab extension* integrates package [mosaik-docker](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) into the interactive [JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/) environment.\n",
    "This allows to use *mosaik-docker* in three possible ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Use JupyterLab's graphical user interface\n",
    "+ Use a JupyterLab Python notebook\n",
    "+ Use a JupyterLab terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "An introduction to the *basic workflow* of package *mosaik-docker* can be found [here](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use JupyterLab's graphical user interface\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In JupyterLab, you can execute *mosaik-docker commands* in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ via a side tab to the left\n",
    "+ via a drop down menu in the menu bar on the top\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you can find links to the *mosaik-docker* documentation, this guide and other resources on bottom of the main Launcher tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The mosaik-docker side bar, drop-down menu and documentation links.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images//lab_launcher.png \"The mosaik-docker side bar, drop-down menu and documentation links.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Configure simulation setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The configuration for the simulation setup is stored in file ``mosaik-docker.json``.\n",
    "It contains all relevant information for running a dockerized mosaik simulation\n",
    "It is highly recommended to NOT edit this configuration file by hand, but to use command ``Configure Simulation Setup`` from the side tab or the drop-down menu.\n",
    "This will bring up a new tab, in which the following configuration items can be edited (all paths either relative to simulation setup directory or absolute):\n",
    "\n",
    "+ path to mosaik scenario file\n",
    "+ path to Dockerfile for mosaik sim manager\n",
    "+ input files and/or folders (optional)\n",
    "+ output files (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have provided all configuration items, you can save this information via the ``UPDATE CONFIGURATION`` button on the bottom right of the configuration tab.\n",
    "\n",
    "![View of the simulation setup configuration tab.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_config.png \"View of the simulation setup configuration tab.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Check and build simulation setup\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use command ``Check Simulation Setup`` to check if your simulation setup is valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Result of a successfull validity check of a simulation setup.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_check.png \"Result of a successfull validity check of a simulation setup.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your setup seems to be fine, you can use command ``Build Simulation Setup`` to build the Docker images for running your simulation.\n",
    "This will bring up a new tab, on which you can see the output from the Docker image build process.\n",
    "\n",
    "![View of the simulation setup build tab.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_build.png \"View of the simulation setup build tab.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Run simulations and check their status\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the Docker images have been successfully built, you can use command ``Start Simulation`` to start new simulation runs.\n",
    "Simulations are assigned an ID that allows to refer to them for monitoring and further interaction (get results, cancel, clear).\n",
    "Starting a new simulation will bring up a notification showing its ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Starting a new simulation will bring up a notification showing its ID.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_sim_start.png \"Starting a new simulation will bring up a notification showing its ID.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Use command ``Check Simulation Status`` to check the status of your simulations.\n",
    "This will bring up a new tab listing the running and finished simulations (based on simulation IDs).\n",
    "\n",
    "![View of the simulation status view tab.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_sim_status.png \"View of the simulation status view tab.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieve simulation results\n",
    "\n",
    "After a simulation has successfully finished, you can use command ``Get Simulation Results`` to retrieve the corresponding results.\n",
    "This will bring up a panel that lets you select to retrieve the results from either a specific simulation (drop down menu) or from all (checkbox).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Dialog for retrieving simulation results.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_sim_get.png \"Dialog for retrieving simulation results.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "For each selected simulation, the output files specified in the simulation setup configuration (see above) will be copied from the corresponding Docker container and copied to a sub-directory named according to the simulation ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Simulations results are copied to individual subfolders.](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/projects/jupyter/en/latest/_images/lab_browser_results.png \"Simulations results are copied to individual subfolders.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use a JupyterLab terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to the GUI, you can use the *mosaik-docker* command line interface (CLI).\n",
    "Simply start a new terminal from JupyterLab's Launcher tab (see [here](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli-reference.html) for further details).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use a JupyterLab Python notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to the GUI and CLI, you can use the *mosaik-docker* Python API.\n",
    "This is especially usefull for automating your workflow.\n",
    "Simply start a new Python notebook from JupyterLab's Launcher tab and import package ``mosaik_docker.cli`` (see [here](https://mosaik-docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-reference.html) for further details).\n"
